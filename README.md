Quantum Computing Simulator
Welcome to the Quantum Computing Simulator project! This web-based platform allows users to experiment with quantum algorithms by visualizing and interacting with quantum gates, circuits, and algorithms. The implementation uses web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is powered by Python with quantum computing libraries like Qiskit and Cirq.

Project Structure
index.html: The main HTML file serving as the entry point for the web application. It contains the basic structure of the page.

styles.css: This CSS file provides styles to make the web page visually appealing and user-friendly.

main.js: The main JavaScript file responsible for handling user interactions, manipulating the DOM, and communicating with the backend.

quantumSimulator.py: The main Python file for the backend, where the logic is implemented using quantum computing libraries (Qiskit, Cirq) to simulate quantum algorithms.

requirements.txt: Lists all Python dependencies needed for the project, including the quantum computing libraries.

Getting Started
To run the Quantum Computing Simulator locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Python installed on your machine
Quantum computing libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt)
Running the Simulator
Open index.html in your preferred web browser.

Explore the interactive quantum simulator, visualize quantum gates, and experiment with quantum algorithms.

QuantumSimulator.py Overview
The quantumSimulator.py file contains the backend logic for simulating quantum algorithms. Here's a brief overview:
